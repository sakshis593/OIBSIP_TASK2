           <br>
           <li>Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje, now North Macedonia, in 1910. At the age of 18, she joined the Sisters of Loreto and was sent to India, where she taught for many years.</li>
           <br><br><br>
           <li>In 1946, Mother Teresa received what she described as a "call within a call" to serve the poorest of the poor. She received permission from the Catholic Church to leave her teaching position and began working in the slums of Kolkata.</li>

            <br>
            <li>In 1950, Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a congregation dedicated to serving the poorest of the poor. The organization grew rapidly, and by the time of Mother Teresa's death in 1997, it had established more than 700 missions in over 130 countries.</li>
            <br><br><br>
            <li>Mother Teresa's greatest contribution was her love and compassion for the poor and sick. She dedicated her life to serving those in need, regardless of their religion or social status. She established hospices and clinics for the sick and dying, providing them with medical care and support. She also set up homes for abandoned and orphaned children.</li>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <li>In addition to her humanitarian work, Mother Teresa was a vocal advocate for the rights of the poor and marginalized. She spoke out against poverty, injustice, and inequality, and encouraged others to do the same. Her efforts earned her numerous awards and recognition, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.</li>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <li>Mother Teresa's life and work continue to inspire people around the world to serve the poor and needy. She is widely regarded as a symbol of selflessness and compassion, and her legacy lives on through the Missionaries of Charity and other organizations dedicated to helping those in need.</li>
